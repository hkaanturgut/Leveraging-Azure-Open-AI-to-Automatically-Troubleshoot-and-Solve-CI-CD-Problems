## üìú Azure DevOps Terraform Pipeline

### **Filepath**: [`pipelines/terraform-pipeline.yml`](pipelines/terraform-pipeline.yml)

Automates Terraform deployment with the following stages:
1. **TerraformInit**:
   - Initializes, formats, and validates configurations.
2. **TerraformPlan**:
   - Generates an execution plan for changes.
3. **ManualApproval**:
   - Requires manual review before proceeding.
4. **TerraformApply**:
   - Applies the plan to deploy infrastructure.
