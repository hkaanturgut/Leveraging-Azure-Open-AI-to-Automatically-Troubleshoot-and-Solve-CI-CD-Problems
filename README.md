## üìÅ Repository Structure

| **File Name**         | **Description**                                                                 |
|------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [`main.tf`](main.tf)   | Main infrastructure resources: resource groups, AI services, and role assignments. |
| [`variables.tf`](variables.tf) | Configurable parameters like resource names and locations.                       |
| [`providers.tf`](providers.tf) | Azure provider and configuration settings.                                    |
| [`outputs.tf`](outputs.tf)     | Deployment outputs such as resource IDs and connection strings.              |

## üìú Azure DevOps Terraform Pipeline

### **Filepath**: [`pipelines/terraform-pipeline.yml`](pipelines/terraform-pipeline.yml)

Automates Terraform deployment with the following stages:
1. **TerraformInit**:
   - Initializes, formats, and validates configurations.
2. **TerraformPlan**:
   - Generates an execution plan for changes.
3. **ManualApproval**:
   - Requires manual review before proceeding.
4. **TerraformApply**:
   - Applies the plan to deploy infrastructure.

## üßë‚Äçüíª AI Assistant Script

A Python script that leverages Azure OpenAI to analyze CI/CD pipeline errors and suggest solutions.

### **Filepath**: [`./ai-assistant.py`](./ai-assistant.py)

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Failing Build Pipeline

### **Filepath**: [`pipelines/build-pipeline.yml`](pipelines/build-pipeline.yml)

Simulates pipeline failures and triggers debugging:
1. **BuildAndAnalyze Stage**:
   - Runs tasks while tolerating failures for debugging.
2. **TriggerAiDebugPipeline Stage**:
   - Initiates AI debugging if failures occur.

---

## ü§ñ AI Debug Pipeline

### **Filepath**: [`pipelines/ai-debug-pipeline.yml`](pipelines/ai-debug-pipeline.yml)

Designed to debug failures using AI tools:
- Retrieves and analyzes logs.
- Uses OpenAI to suggest solutions.
- Sends results to a Logic App for processing.

---

## üéâ Why This Project Stands Out
- **Cutting-Edge AI Integration**: Uses Azure OpenAI for real-time debugging.
- **Streamlined Automation**: Combines DevOps best practices with AI insights.
- **Scalable Design**: Modular and reusable Terraform configurations.
